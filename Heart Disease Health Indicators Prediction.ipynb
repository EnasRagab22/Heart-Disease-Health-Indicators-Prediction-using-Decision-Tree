    "# Decision Trees in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees (DTs) stand out as powerful non-parametric supervised learning methods. They find applications in both classification and regression tasks. The primary objective of DTs is to create a predictive model for a target variable by learning simple decision rules derived from the features of the data. Two key entities in decision trees are the root node, where the data splits, and decision nodes or leaves, where the final output is obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Tree Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### ID3\n",
    "\n",
    "Developed by Ross Quinlan in 1986, the Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3) algorithm aims to identify categorical features at each node that yield the largest information gain for categorical targets. It allows the tree to grow to its maximum size and then employs a pruning step to enhance its performance on unseen data. The output of this algorithm is a multiway tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C4.5\n",
    "\n",
    "C4.5, the successor to ID3, dynamically defines discrete attributes that partition continuous attribute values into a set of intervals. This eliminates the restriction of categorical features. C4.5 transforms the ID3-trained tree into sets of 'IF-THEN' rules. To determine the sequence in which these rules should be applied, the accuracy of each rule is evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C5.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to C4.5, C5.0 uses less memory and builds smaller rulesets. It operates by generating binary splits using features and thresholds that yield the largest information gain at each node. While it shares similarities with C4.5, it offers increased accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CART\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm generates binary splits by utilizing features and thresholds that maximize information gain, as measured by the Gini index, at each node. Homogeneity is determined by the Gini index, with higher values indicating greater homogeneity. Unlike C4.5, CART does not compute rule sets and does not support numerical target variables (regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Tree Algorithm Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the term \"decision tree algorithm\" commonly refers to a family of algorithms responsible for constructing decision trees. The specific implementation details can vary based on the chosen algorithm and its parameters. Despite these differences, a common theme across these algorithms is the idea of recursively partitioning the data using features and criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "This recursive partitioning process involves iteratively making decisions at each node to split the data based on specific conditions. The goal is to create a tree structure where the leaves represent the final outcomes or predictions. The variations among decision tree algorithms lie in how they select features, determine splitting criteria, handle categorical and numerical data, and address overfitting through techniques like pruning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flexibility in implementation allows practitioners to choose the decision tree algorithm that best suits their specific use case, considering factors such as interpretability, computational efficiency, and performance on different types of data."

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided dataset revolves around the classification problem of predicting the likelihood of individuals experiencing heart disease or heart attack based on various health-related features. Each row in the dataset represents an individual, and the columns encompass diverse attributes such as blood pressure (`HighBP`), cholesterol levels (`HighChol`, `CholCheck`), body mass index (`BMI`), smoking habits (`Smoker`), history of stroke (`Stroke`), diabetes status (`Diabetes`), engagement in physical activity (`PhysActivity`), and consumption of fruits, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable, \"`HeartDiseaseorAttack`,\" is binary, indicating whether an individual has experienced a heart disease or heart attack (`1.0`) or not (`0.0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this classification problem, a decision tree algorithm can be employed. Decision trees are particularly effective in handling both categorical and numerical data, making them well-suited for this diverse dataset. The decision tree will learn to navigate through the feature space, making splits based on the values of different features to ultimately classify individuals into the two categories of heart disease or no heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree model can help unveil the significant features contributing to the prediction of heart disease, providing insights into the factors that play a crucial role in determining an individual's cardiovascular health. Additionally, the interpretability of decision trees allows for a clear understanding of the decision-making process, making it valuable for both predictive modeling and gaining actionable insights into heart disease risk factors."

MenHlth & PhyHlth has too many different values, so for us it was not a good way to one hot encode them. The other we have one hot encoded to have a better working model.

    "## Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "This report analyzes the performance of three machine learning models—Decision Tree, RandomForest, and XGBoost—in predicting the likelihood of heart disease or heart attack based on a diverse set of health-related features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Decision Tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test Accuracy:** 89.22%\n",
    "- **Precision (weighted):** 90%\n",
    "- **Recall (weighted):** 89%\n",
    "- **F1 Score (weighted):** 89%\n",

    "  [[19458, 3644]\n",
    "   [1312, 21543]]\n",

    "\n",
    "### Observations:\n",
    "The Decision Tree model demonstrates strong predictive performance with an accuracy of 89.22%. It exhibits a balanced precision and recall, suggesting reliable predictions for both positive and negative instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. RandomForest:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test Accuracy:** 90.01%\n",
    "- **Precision (weighted):** 90%\n",
    "- **Recall (weighted):** 90%\n",

    "- **Confusion Matrix:**\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  [[19771, 3331]\n",
    "   [1262, 21593]]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations:\n",
    "The RandomForest model outperforms the Decision Tree with an accuracy of 90.01%. It shows an impressive balance between precision and recall, indicating robust performance in identifying both true positive and true negative cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. XGBoost:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test Accuracy:** 78.82%\n",
    "- **Precision (weighted):** 79%\n",
    "- **Recall (weighted):** 79%\n",
    "- **F1 Score (weighted):** 79%\n",
    "- **Confusion Matrix:**\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  [[17170, 5932]\n",
    "   [3800, 19055]]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations:\n",
    "The XGBoost model exhibits a lower accuracy of 78.82% compared to the other models. While it maintains a good balance between precision and recall, its overall performance is slightly lower than the RandomForest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The RandomForest model emerges as the top performer, achieving the highest accuracy and balanced precision and recall.\n",
    "- The Decision Tree model follows closely, showcasing commendable performance with a slightly lower accuracy than the RandomForest.\n",
    "- XGBoost, while providing reasonable results, falls behind the other models in terms of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of the best model depends on specific use cases and priorities. RandomForest appears to be a reliable choice for accurate predictions in this scenario, while the Decision Tree offers a good balance between performance and interpretability. Further model fine-tuning and optimization could potentially enhance overall results.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to consider the trade-offs between model complexity, interpretability, and performance when selecting the most suitable model for deployment. Additionally, continuous monitoring and validation on new data are recommended to ensure consistent and reliable predictions."
