# ❤️ Heart Disease Health Indicators Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health indicators such as BMI, smoking habits, physical activity, and more.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 Predicts heart disease based on health indicators  
- 📊 Analyzes structured health data  
- ⚙️ Uses models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.  
- 📈 Evaluates with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EnasRagab22/Heart-Disease-Health-Indicators-Prediction-using-Decision-Tree.git
   cd Heart_Disease_Health_Indicators_Prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
